<h4>Making links and breaking codes:<br>
A public lecture to celebrate the centenary of mathematician Bill Tutte
</h4>

<p>
7pm Tuesday 5th December 2017<br>
South 1 lecture theatre, 43 Rainforest Walk, Monash Clayton
</p>

<p>
Speaker:<br>
<a href="http://users.monash.edu/~gfarr/">Professor Graham Farr</a><br>
Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University
</p>

<p> William (Bill) Tutte (1917-2002) became a research mathematician 
while still an undergraduate at Cambridge in the late 1930s, broke the 
toughest Nazi codes while at Bletchley Park in the Second World War, and 
became one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century.  His 
wartime work sparked the secret construction of Colossus, one of the 
first-ever computers, and saved countless lives.  After the war, he led 
the development of the mathematics of networks, known as Graph Theory.  
His work was usually inspired by pure curiosity or entertaining puzzles, 
but has been applied in domains as diverse as electrical circuits, 
statistical physics and information visualisation.  This talk tells the 
story of Tutte's life, mathematics and code-breaking to a broad 
audience. </p>

<p>Attendance is free and open to anyone.  No booking is required. Also see:
