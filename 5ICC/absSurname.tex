\title A Proof of the Prime Power Conjecture

\text 
We prove the famous Prime Power Conjecture for existence of
finite projective planes by reducing it to the simpler problem of
showing that the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ has no zeroes in the
complex plane other than along the real axis and the line with real
part equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. 

This latter problem turns out to be trivial to solve, and we give an
elementary proof in the margin.
